# Microsoft MVP
The MVP Award Program is a community - and you've always been there for each-other! 
A lot of you want to help us make this community better, including creating a better experience for submitting contributions. 
The MVP Connector will directly enable you to use your own ideas to create and enhance your own MVP experience.
Microsoft MVP connector, by an MVP for all MVPs :)
